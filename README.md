# APC_64_40_9

Remote script for the Akai APC40 with Ableton Live 9. Originally developed by [Hanz Petrov](http://remotescripts.blogspot.com/p/apc-64-40.html)

This fork replaces the grid user mode 8 (non-triggering MIDI notes) with an 8 channel + master VU-meter display on the APC40 grid. Useful as a mixing mode or as a makeshift visualizer when playing live. Makes it much easier to know which track you're selecting or adjusting without referring to your monitor.

Updated by [Fabrizio Poce](http://www.fabriziopoce.com/download.html) for Live 9. Final update released [on the Ableton forums](https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=204713).

Uses parts from [Will Marshall's APCAdvanced script](https://github.com/willrjmarshall/AbletonDJTemplateUnsupported) for the VU metering.
